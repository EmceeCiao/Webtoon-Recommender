# Webtoon-Recommender (Outdated)  

## Outdated Label Explanation 
Since Twitter's Ownership changed a while back, this code is OUTDATED!
This is because Tweepy API has been changed 
as Twitter has changed its free API model to a paid one.

## Inspiration For Project
This project was created for a class and the project simply entailed using 
a limited version of Tweepy API provided to us called simple_twit. 
Giving students the flexibility to create what they wanted. 

For this project, I decided to create a TwitterBot that would recommend a 
Webtoon series that updated on that specific day along with a generic genre 
specific comment on the latest chapter.  

I went with this project, as at the time I was an avid reader of Webtoons 
and thought it would be fun to recommend a series that I was currently reading 
as well. 

## Comments on The Project Itself
This project had been done when I was sort of at the beginning of learning how
to code, so the bot had not been hosted on a server/automated to tweet every day 
at a specific time. Instead, the code was made so that you would have to manually 
run it in order to tweet out a recommendation and I made it so that if the code was 
executed multiple times in one day it would make sure not to recommend the same series. 

If I could update the project, I would 

1) Host it on a server so the bot tweets every day
2) Scrape data from Webtoon to give an actual ranking of where the series stands
3) Separate the code and functions into separate files, my inexperience with coding when
   making this project shines through with how it's all in one file.
