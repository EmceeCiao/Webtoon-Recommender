# Webtoon-Recommender (Outdated)  

## Outdated Label Explanation 
Since Twitter's Ownership changed a while back, this code is OUTDATED!
This is because simple_twit API has been rendered no longer functional 
as Twitter has changed its free API model to a paid one.

## Inspiration For Project
This project was created for a class and the project simply entailed using 
simple_twit API. Giving students the flexibility to create what they wanted. 

For this project, I decided to create a TwitterBot that would recommend a 
Webtoon series that updated on that specific day along with a generic genre 
specific comment on the latest chapter.  

I went with this project, as at the time I was an avid reader of Webtoons 
and thought it would be fun to recommend a series that I was currently reading 
as well. 

## Comments on The Project Itself
This project had been done when I was sort of at the beginning of learning how
to code, so the bot had not been hosted on a server/automated to tweet every day 
at a specific time. Instead, the code was made so that you would have to manually 
run it in order to tweet out a recommendation and I made it so that if the code was 
executed multiple times in one day it would make sure not to recommend the same series.
